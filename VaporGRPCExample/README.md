# Swift Server Example

Very basic and simple gRPC server-side example on Swift language.
It's just for local usage, no deploy and settings and CI/CD.
You can find specs for RPC functions in Specs folder along with generate script.
                
Used [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/) framework for developing server-side part on swift
And [grpc-swift](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift) for implementing grpc part.
